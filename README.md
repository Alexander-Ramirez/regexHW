## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are always used at the begging and end of an expression, /^ is the beginning and $/ is the end

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers state how many charaters are to be expected as well as a certain pattern to pass through

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping Constructs allow people to take apart normal regular expressions and be used to match and catch substrings of the string

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket Expresions state that whatever is being passed needs to match whats inside the brackets 

### Character Classes
Character classes sets us a special notation that allows people to match any symbol or character

### The OR Operator
| is the OR Operator and it looks to see if either side matches the criteria and lets it go

### Flags
Flags are a single alphabetic charater that is able to set a certain rule or a modifier to be exact for example "i" ignores all case sensitive items

### Character Escapes
Character Escapes is a character that invokes an invokes an alternative interpretation, so basically charaters after a sequence can be seen in a different way
